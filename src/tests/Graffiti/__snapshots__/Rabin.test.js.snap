    This piece of graffiti, as you hover over the image above, shows it is a painting of an actual photograph.  That photograph depicts the exact moment when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated in 1995.  When someone attempted to paint over this mural, people got upset and started protesting.  Since then, it has been declared protected.
