Growing up as a Jewish American in Portland, Oregon, I often heard about the land of the Jewish people: Israel.  Attending Jewish School, studying to become a Bar Mitzvah, going to the Portland Jewish Academy (PJA) in the 7th Grade, I often wondered what life would be like in the land of Israel.  Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the Dead Sea, all the places mentioned in the Torah.  To me, an important step of understanding Judiasm is to experience it in Israel.

I could've taken the opportunity in the 8th Grade at the PJA, but was it worth it to be the only boy in my class that year, at a school where I didn't fit in?  The clear answer was no, and thus, I went back to public Middle School and didn't go to Israel.  Years went by before I had another opportunity to go to Israel.

When I was 26 years old, I learned of Birthright Israel, a program that allowed people who have never been to Israel before, an opportunity to travel there with little or no cost to get and stay there.  After all, it's important for people of the Jewish faith to visit the land of Israel at least once in their life.  I was psyched having learned this, to help me get in touch with my Jewish roots.

But the powers that be prevented me from going.  I was denied the chance; not enough room for Adam to go, Birthright told me, even though it would seem they would want someone like me who was at the age limit of 26.  So it seemed like I would never be able to go to Israel.  I'm not made of money;  and it's certainly not as easy as writing a check.  So years went by, wondering what could have been.  But then, last December, I received an e-mail I never expected: Birthright Israel was extendng the age limit to people up to 32 years old, which once again, gave myself an opportunity to go, right at the age limit.  Suddenly, a second chance at Israel presented itself.

Now had to be the time.  I am far more mature this time around, and able to handle myself for such a big trip, both physically, mentally and socially.  So when I applied this time around, I was all in, applying at the very first chance I could get, with no technical issues stopping me.  I intially applied for the trip in May, unable to go in the Summer due to work scheduling issues.  But as weeks went by, I saw deja vu all over again, thinking I would be denied yet again.  They offered a fall trip, but I figured I wasn't eligible since I would be 33.  After questioning them, I was thankfully told I was wrong; I was eligible since I applied as a 32 year old.  And with that, I was accepted into Birthright Israel.  My second chance was granted.  I never thought I'd get it, but as my Mom always tells me, things happen for a reason.

The journey to Israel began by flying to the Newark Airport, where our group met.  For plenty, it was a short or fairly short drive away.  For me, it was flying across country and spending the night in Newark.  To get to Newark, I flew first to the Detroit Airport, then to the Newark Airport.  Fortunately, the layover in Detroit was only about an hour, and the gates were basically next to each other.  That made things less stress free.  What didn&apos;t make things stress free was getting to the hotel from the airport.

${elAlIntro}

I had naturally figured I&apos;d book a hotel near the airport.  My plan was to order an Uber and head to the hotel a few minutes away and I would get some sleep before going back to the airport.  But reaching the hotel, the clerk didn&apos;t recognize my name, and looking at my confirmation, I realized I had booked my room at another hotel.  Instead of being near the airport, I instead booked it in North Bergen, about 20 minutes away.  Now I needed another Uber ride to get to the right hotel.  On the one hand, I got a nice evening time tour of downtown Newark.  On the other hand, it was about 11:00 pm and I was desperate to check in, which would&apos;ve been worse if not coming from the West Coast.  By the time I got to the my hotel, it was almost Midnight, and I was ready to crash for the beginning of an eventful trip to Israel.

Flying to Israel, the best way to fly is through their official carrier, El Al.  The journey to Israel began at the check-in counter, where the Birthright group met.  Not wanting to stay at my hotel in North Bergen, New Jersey, for long, I left as early as I could but not arrive super early.  I ended up arriving around 8:15 or so.  The group was small, but thanks to Zach&apos;s gray Lowe&apos;s jacket he mentioned on our Facebook page, I knew I was in the right section.

For the next hour, more and more people showed up, with the early birds like me pointing out to them "Check in over there" where are staff member Anabelle was sitting, complete with name tags for everyone to wear.  Once the other staff member Jake arrived, having just flown to the aiport from Israel, we were ready to get our first instructions.

We learned of our next steps, and then found out about El Al&apos;s extra security measures.  Before going through TSA, one must face questions from airline representatives.  A &apos;lucky&apos; few got an additional round of questioning.  It&apos;s as if they wanted to know your life story.  Fortunately for me, I wasn&apos;t one of the lucky ones.  Once through the TSA, our group was given a couple of hours to rest before meeting up with our staff.  After passing through the creepy New Jersey Hall of Fame kiosks featuring such umremarkable famous New Jersians as Connie Chung and someone else I don&apos;t even remember, rest was really needed.  Unfortunately, the more convenient charging stations for my iPhone and watch didn&apos;t work.  Only in New Jersey, I suppose.

At 11:30, it was time for our first activity to get to know each other better.  We had a ball with random questions to answer.  Our question was based on where our right thumb landed on the ball.  I got hit in the head when the ball was passed to me, but I answered my unremarkable question of what my favorite sports championship game to watch (Basketball).  Other questions were quite silly.

After learning of the next steps, we finally got to board the plane.  What a huge plane it was!  I was amazed to find out my seat was in row 57.  Of course, I ended up in the very last row.  There were three sections of the plane.  I was in the middle section on the aisle to the left side.  The bathroom was across the aisle from me.  It was so close, I could grab toilet paper from the bathroom while remaining in my seat.  The seats were as comfy for an airplane, and with TV screens in front of you, there was plenty of entertainment.  You could watch movies, TV shows, listen to music, and view the airplane&apos; location, with an interactive interface and virtual views of just about anything you could imagine; from the standard view to Cockpit view.  Even their safety video was more entertaining than you would ever find in America.

Thankfully, there was plenty of entertainment available, because the flight was 10 hours from Newark to Tel Aviv.  We were provided two meals, both with a certificate of Kashruth (sorry Uncle Fred, no Ham and Cheese sandwich).  There were plenty of Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men on the plane, who refused to sit next to females.  They also congregated to the back of the plane, where I was, appearing to pray.  I tried to get some sleep on the plane.  I thought I was in a good position to do so.  In the back of the plane, in an aisle, and decent leg room.  But despite my best efforts, I just couldn&apos;t do it.  I ended up watching Mission Impossible: Fallout, which I&apos;d never seen before as it was new, and having watched Rogue Nation a few days before, it was perfect for me to watch Fallout. After 10 hours, we finally landed in Israel at around 6:30 am, local time.

# Fun Facts about El Al

After 10 hours of flying, our plane finally landed in Israel.  Upon landing, it felt almost surreal.  It felt like the dawn of the night, but yet it was 6:30 in the morning local time.  The past week, I kept saying to myself "I can't believe I'm going to Israel."  Suddenly, it was, "I can't believe I made it to Israel."

export const benGurion = ` # First Thoughts of Israel

${benGurionIntro}

What really got to me was the Hebrew writing mixed in with the English, along with Arabic as well.  I had been to Europe twice, but never in another country with a different alphabet than ours.  Eventually, after picking up our bags at Baggage Claim, with very specific instructions NOT to go through Customs, we got the lecture on how our first day would turn out.  No time for rest, but there would be plenty of that during Shabbat.  Perfect way to beat the Jet Lag!

Walking outside for the first time, I noticed the sun starting to rise and all the palm trees.  I also saw what ended up being the first of many, many cats.  I found myself in awe being in Israel, definitely far away from home.  So while we were introduced to our tour guide, Hadas, I tried my best to listen but was overwhelmed with excitement.  By the time our introduction was done, it was time to put our bags on the bus and head off to Jerusalem&apos;s Old City.

Leaving the airport and heading towards Jerusalem, I immediately thought of arriving in Italy years ago.  The surroundings, the vibe, the weather, reminded me of my first time in Rome.  The main difference, of course, was the Hebrew and Arabic.  I was really exhausted, but was excited for the journey ahead.  That became more clearer when entering Jerusalem, with plenty of sandstone buildings, providing a look that again, reminded me a lot of Rome.

Having arrived just outside the Old City, particularly Jaffa Gate, I once again thought of Rome and all of its historical architecture.  I got a glimpse of modernism with a Welcome to Taglit Birthright Israel sign, which I had to get a selfie in front of.  It was also my first chance to get for WiFi outside the airport, as well as my first chance to really ask, "Where's the Bathroom?"  I declined to go the first time, focusing on taking every picture I could in the park we stopped at.  But before we could actually go inside the Old City, first we needed an icebreaker and a history lesson.

${oldJerusalemIntro}

Like with other group activities, we were all in a circle, and we had to answer a question given to us and ask the next person another.  I was first so I couldn&apos;t think of a more creative question other than favorite animal.  Then we had to go in reverse.  The answer to my question was Jerusalem.  How original!  After the icebreaker, we walked towards to gate of the Old City, where we got a nice view of the area and got a history lesson.

In order to understand the long and complicated history of Jerusalem, we got to learn from Hadas just how many people controlled the Land of Israel and the length of time.  We also learned that by positioning your body in a certain way, you can effectively make yourself resemble a map of Israel.  Once done with our history lesson, we headed towards the Zion Gate, where we entered the Old City.

Looking at all the ancient history, I felt inspired and mesmerized with everything I saw.  The walls, the buildings, the scenery surrounding the gates, everything.  It was amazing to see.  Further down, you could see the temples and Mosques surrounding the area, a reminder that it&apos;s not all about Judaism in Jerusalem; that it&apos;s also important to the Muslims.  I always found myself fascinated by the architecture of the Dome of the Rock, and though I didn&apos;t see it up close, I could see the Dome and it was a sight to see.

The next stop was just outside the most holiest sight in Judaism, the Western Wall.  But first, we needed to learn the significance of the Western Wall and how it became so important for the Jewish faith.  After learning about the history of the Western Wall and the Second Temple, we got to enter the plaza containing the Western Wall.  But before that, we got a chance to write a message on a piece of paper to place within the cracks of the Western Wall, as is custom.  Entering the plaza, it was admittedly weird to me to have a Male and Female entrance, but that is part of Orthodox Judaism.

Upon being in the plaza and going to the Western Wall itself, I felt emotion and compassion, thinking of my message and placing it in the cracks, thankful for all of my loving family, old and new, that blessed me with love and kindness throughout this special year.  I didn&apos;t expect to feel such emotion, but I did.  And with that, I left satisfied with what I did.  Things happen for a reason, and perhaps, there was a hidden reason my trip came during the most unexpected year ever.

Leaving the Western Wall, we headed towards the main square of the Jewish Quarter, but before we made it there, we had one more discussion about the area.  This time though, the majority of us were distracted by the events that were about to happen in the vicinity.  Rested along the wall were flowers with the phrase "Marry Me."  We had stumbled upon an elaborate marriage proposal.  Naturally, we wanted to see it.  A woman carrying her phone was waiting to record the whole ordeal, and a small boom box sat in the space waiting for the couple to be to make their entrance.  Eventually, the lucky couple walked in, and the whole thing was recorded for us to see.  We weren&apos;t completely certain of it, but the woman said yes.  It seems intimate touching isn&apos;t allowed, hence our confusion.  But everyone watching congratulated the couple.  It was romance at its finest.  The nugget of the day, the unexpected thing that brings joy in your life.  And whoever they are, hopefully they will be a happy couple for the rest of their lives.

We made it to the center of the Jewish Quarter, home of the Hurva Synagogue.  The area was quite equisite; down to the break dancers dancing in front of the Synagogue.  I also found myself interested in the building to its left, dedicated to someone in Baltimore, Maryland an interesting thing to see in the center of the Jewish Quarter.  I also liked the Lego Guys at one of the restaurants.  That was pretty neat to see.  But after struggling to find, you guessed it, the bathroom, it was time to end our journey in the Old City, and head for the Shuk, where all the food and gifts could be bought for some Shekels.  One more chat about the Old City and the Jewish Quarter, and we left the Old City for the Shuk.



# Facts about the Old City of Jerusalem
![Old City of Jerusalem](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Jerusalem_oldcity_English.jpg/400px-Jerusalem_oldcity_English.jpg)
