Growing up as a Jewish American in Portland, Oregon, I often heard about the land of the Jewish people: Israel.  Attending Jewish School, studying to become a Bar Mitzvah, going to the Portland Jewish Academy (PJA) in the 7th Grade, I often wondered what life would be like in the land of Israel.  Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, the Dead Sea, all the places mentioned in the Torah.  To me, an important step of understanding Judaism is to experience it in Israel.

I could've taken the opportunity in the 8th Grade at the PJA, but was it worth it to be the only boy in my class that year, at a school where I didn't fit in?  The clear answer was no, and thus, I went back to public Middle School and didn't go to Israel.  Years went by before I had another opportunity to go to Israel.

When I was 26 years old, I learned of Birthright Israel, a program that allowed people who have never been to Israel before, an opportunity to travel there with little or no cost to get and stay there.  After all, it's important for people of the Jewish faith to visit the land of Israel at least once in their life.  I was psyched having learned this, to help me get in touch with my Jewish roots.

But the powers that be prevented me from going.  I was denied the chance; not enough room for Adam to go, Birthright told me, even though it would seem they would want someone like me who was at the age limit of 26.  So it seemed like I would never be able to go to Israel.  I'm not made of money;  and it's certainly not as easy as writing a check.  So years went by, wondering what could have been.  But then, last December, I received an email I never expected: Birthright Israel was extending the age limit to people up to 32 years old, which once again, gave myself an opportunity to go, right at the age limit.  Suddenly, a second chance at Israel presented itself.

Now had to be the time.  I am far more mature this time around, and able to handle myself for such a big trip, both physically, mentally and socially.  So when I applied this time around, I was all in, applying at the very first chance I could get, with no technical issues stopping me.  I initially applied for the trip in May, unable to go in the Summer due to work scheduling issues.  But as weeks went by, I saw deja vu all over again, thinking I would be denied yet again.  They offered a fall trip, but I figured I wasn't eligible since I would be 33.  After questioning them, I was thankfully told I was wrong; I was eligible since I applied as a 32 year old.  And with that, I was accepted into Birthright Israel.  My second chance was granted.  I never thought I'd get it, but as my Mom always tells me, things happen for a reason.

The journey to Israel began by flying to the Newark Airport, where our group met.  For plenty, it was a short or fairly short drive away.  For me, it was flying across country and spending the night in Newark.  To get to Newark, I flew first to the Detroit Airport, then to the Newark Airport.  Fortunately, the layover in Detroit was only about an hour, and the gates were basically next to each other.  That made things less stress free.  What didn't make things stress free was getting to the hotel from the airport.
`;

${elAlIntro}

I had naturally figured I'd book a hotel near the airport.  My plan was to order an Uber and head to the hotel a few minutes away and I would get some sleep before going back to the airport.  But reaching the hotel, the clerk didn't recognize my name, and looking at my confirmation, I realized I had booked my room at another hotel.  Instead of being near the airport, I instead booked it in North Bergen, about 20 minutes away.  Now I needed another Uber ride to get to the right hotel.  On the one hand, I got a nice evening time tour of downtown Newark.  On the other hand, it was about 11:00 pm and I was desperate to check in, which would've been worse if not coming from the West Coast.  By the time I got to the my hotel, it was almost Midnight, and I was ready to crash for the beginning of an eventful trip to Israel.

Flying to Israel, the best way to fly is through their official carrier, El Al.  The journey to Israel began at the check-in counter, where the Birthright group met.  Not wanting to stay at my hotel in North Bergen, New Jersey, for long, I left as early as I could but not arrive super early.  I ended up arriving around 8:15 or so.  The group was small, but thanks to Zach's gray Lowe's jacket he mentioned on our Facebook page, I knew I was in the right section.

For the next hour, more and more people showed up, with the early birds like me pointing out to them "Check in over there" where are staff member Anabelle was sitting, complete with name tags for everyone to wear.  Once the other staff member Jake arrived, having just flown to the airport from Israel, we were ready to get our first instructions.

We learned of our next steps, and then found out about El Al's extra security measures.  Before going through TSA, one must face questions from airline representatives.  A 'lucky' few got an additional round of questioning.  It's as if they wanted to know your life story.  Fortunately for me, I wasn't one of the lucky ones.  Once through the TSA, our group was given a couple of hours to rest before meeting up with our staff.  After passing through the creepy New Jersey Hall of Fame kiosks featuring such unremarkable famous New Jerseyans as Connie Chung and someone else I don't even remember, rest was really needed.  Unfortunately, the more convenient charging stations for my iPhone and watch didn't work.  Only in New Jersey, I suppose.

At 11:30, it was time for our first activity to get to know each other better.  We had a ball with random questions to answer.  Our question was based on where our right thumb landed on the ball.  I got hit in the head when the ball was passed to me, but I answered my unremarkable question of what my favorite sports championship game to watch (Basketball).  Other questions were quite silly.

After learning of the next steps, we finally got to board the plane.  What a huge plane it was!  I was amazed to find out my seat was in row 57.  Of course, I ended up in the very last row.  There were three sections of the plane.  I was in the middle section on the aisle to the left side.  The bathroom was across the aisle from me.  It was so close, I could grab toilet paper from the bathroom while remaining in my seat.  The seats were as comfy for an airplane, and with TV screens in front of you, there was plenty of entertainment.  You could watch movies, TV shows, listen to music, and view the airplane' location, with an interactive interface and virtual views of just about anything you could imagine; from the standard view to Cockpit view.  Even their safety video was more entertaining than you would ever find in America.

[![EL AL Safety Video](http://img.youtube.com/vi/_6akiuRlEF8/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6akiuRlEF8)

Thankfully, there was plenty of entertainment available, because the flight was 10 hours from Newark to Tel Aviv.  We were provided two meals, both with a certificate of Kashruth (sorry Uncle Fred, no Ham and Cheese sandwich).  There were plenty of Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men on the plane, who refused to sit next to females.  They also congregated to the back of the plane, where I was, appearing to pray.  I tried to get some sleep on the plane.  I thought I was in a good position to do so.  In the back of the plane, in an aisle, and decent leg room.  But despite my best efforts, I just couldn't do it.  I ended up watching Mission Impossible: Fallout, which I'd never seen before as it was new, and having watched Rogue Nation a few days before, it was perfect for me to watch Fallout. After 10 hours, we finally landed in Israel at around 6:30 am, local time.

# Fun Facts about El Al
- Its first flight was in September 1948 from Geneva to Tel Aviv
- El Al offers only kosher meals and does not fly on the Sabbath or on major Jewish holidays.
- It's the only commercial airline equipped with missile defense systems to protect itself from surface to air missiles
- In 1991, El Al set a world record for most passengers on a commercial flight, 1,122 on a 747, transporting Jewish refugees from Ethiopia to Israel during Operation Solomon, a mission that helped transport over 14,000 refugees within 36 hours.
- Their company slogan in Hebrew is **הכי בבית בעולם‬**, which they translate as "Home away from Home"

After 10 hours of flying, our plane finally landed in Israel.  Upon landing, it felt almost surreal.  It felt like the dawn of the night, but yet it was 6:30 in the morning local time.  The past week, I kept saying to myself "I can't believe I'm going to Israel."  Suddenly, it was, "I can't believe I made it to Israel."

export const benGurion = ` # First Thoughts of Israel

${benGurionIntro}

What really got to me was the Hebrew writing mixed in with the English, along with Arabic as well.  I had been to Europe twice, but never in another country with a different alphabet than ours.  Eventually, after picking up our bags at Baggage Claim, with very specific instructions NOT to go through Customs, we got the lecture on how our first day would turn out.  No time for rest, but there would be plenty of that during Shabbat.  Perfect way to beat the Jet Lag!

Walking outside for the first time, I noticed the sun starting to rise and all the palm trees.  I also saw what ended up being the first of many, many cats.  I found myself in awe being in Israel, definitely far away from home.  So while we were introduced to our tour guide, Hadas, I tried my best to listen but was overwhelmed with excitement.  By the time our introduction was done, it was time to put our bags on the bus and head off to Jerusalem's Old City.

Leaving the airport and heading towards Jerusalem, I immediately thought of arriving in Italy years ago.  The surroundings, the vibe, the weather, reminded me of my first time in Rome.  The main difference, of course, was the Hebrew and Arabic.  I was really exhausted, but was excited for the journey ahead.  That became more clearer when entering Jerusalem, with plenty of sandstone buildings, providing a look that again, reminded me a lot of Rome.
`;

export const oldJerusalemIntro = `
Having arrived just outside the Old City, particularly Jaffa Gate, I once again thought of Rome and all of its historical architecture.  I got a glimpse of modernism with a Welcome to Taglit Birthright Israel sign, which I had to get a selfie in front of.  It was also my first chance to get for WiFi outside the airport, as well as my first chance to really ask, "Where's the Bathroom?"  I declined to go the first time, focusing on taking every picture I could in the park we stopped at.  But before we could actually go inside the Old City, first we needed an icebreaker and a history lesson.
`;

export const oldJerusalem = `
${oldJerusalemIntro}

Like with other group activities, we were all in a circle, and we had to answer a question given to us and ask the next person another.  I was first so I couldn't think of a more creative question other than favorite animal.  Then we had to go in reverse.  The answer to my question was Jerusalem.  How original!  After the icebreaker, we walked towards to gate of the Old City, where we got a nice view of the area and got a history lesson.

In order to understand the long and complicated history of Jerusalem, we got to learn from Hadas just how many people controlled the Land of Israel and the length of time.  We also learned that by positioning your body in a certain way, you can effectively make yourself resemble a map of Israel.  Once done with our history lesson, we headed towards the Zion Gate, where we entered the Old City.

Looking at all the ancient history, I felt inspired and mesmerized with everything I saw.  The walls, the buildings, the scenery surrounding the gates, everything.  It was amazing to see.  Further down, you could see the temples and Mosques surrounding the area, a reminder that it's not all about Judaism in Jerusalem; that it's also important to the Muslims.  I always found myself fascinated by the architecture of the Dome of the Rock, and though I didn't see it up close, I could see the Dome and it was a sight to see.

The next stop was just outside the most holiest sight in Judaism, the Western Wall.  But first, we needed to learn the significance of the Western Wall and how it became so important for the Jewish faith.  After learning about the history of the Western Wall and the Second Temple, we got to enter the plaza containing the Western Wall.  But before that, we got a chance to write a message on a piece of paper to place within the cracks of the Western Wall, as is custom.  Entering the plaza, it was admittedly weird to me to have a Male and Female entrance, but that is part of Orthodox Judaism.

Upon being in the plaza and going to the Western Wall itself, I felt emotion and compassion, thinking of my message and placing it in the cracks, thankful for all of my loving family, old and new, that blessed me with love and kindness throughout this special year.  I didn't expect to feel such emotion, but I did.  And with that, I left satisfied with what I did.  Things happen for a reason, and perhaps, there was a hidden reason my trip came during the most unexpected year ever.

Leaving the Western Wall, we headed towards the main square of the Jewish Quarter, but before we made it there, we had one more discussion about the area.  This time though, the majority of us were distracted by the events that were about to happen in the vicinity.  Rested along the wall were flowers with the phrase "Marry Me."  We had stumbled upon an elaborate marriage proposal.  Naturally, we wanted to see it.  A woman carrying her phone was waiting to record the whole ordeal, and a small boombox sat in the space waiting for the couple to be to make their entrance.  Eventually, the lucky couple walked in, and the whole thing was recorded for us to see.  We weren't completely certain of it, but the woman said yes.  It seems intimate touching isn't allowed, hence our confusion.  But everyone watching congratulated the couple.  It was romance at its finest.  The nugget of the day, the unexpected thing that brings joy in your life.  And whoever they are, hopefully they will be a happy couple for the rest of their lives.

We made it to the center of the Jewish Quarter, home of the Hurva Synagogue.  The area was quite exquisite; down to the break dancers dancing in front of the Synagogue.  I also found myself interested in the building to its left, dedicated to someone in Baltimore, Maryland an interesting thing to see in the center of the Jewish Quarter.  I also liked the Lego Guys at one of the restaurants.  That was pretty neat to see.  But after struggling to find, you guessed it, the bathroom, it was time to end our journey in the Old City, and head for the Shuk, where all the food and gifts could be bought for some Shekels.  One more chat about the Old City and the Jewish Quarter, and we left the Old City for the Shuk.



# Facts about the Old City of Jerusalem
![Old City of Jerusalem](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/birthright-israel.bodiewebdesign.com/images/main/old-city-jerusalem.jpg)
- There are four uneven Quarters in the Old City: Jewish Quarter, Muslim Quarter, Christian Quarter and Armenian Quarter.
- Until 1868, the entire city of Jerusalem was within the Old City walls.
- The wall of the Old City was built between 1535-1542 by the Turkish sultan **Suleiman the Magnificent**.
- Within the Old City is **Temple Mount**, a hill which the Jewish faith considers the holiest place to pray.  It is also the third most holiest place in Islam, after Mecca and Medina (both in Saudi Arabia).  Christianity also considers Temple Mount to be holy.
- Due to restrictions from entering Temple Mount itself, both political and religious, the **Western Wall**, which borders Temple Mount, is the holiest place for Jews to pray.
- Temple Mount is where the first and second Temple were built for the Jews.  The first temple, known as **Solomon's Temple**, was destroyed in 587 BCE after the Siege of Jerusalem.  The Second Temple was created by Zerubbabel, a governor of the Persian Province of Judah, later expanded by the Roman King of Judea, **Herod the Great**, but was destroyed in 70 CE.  
- The Western Wall was originally built as part of the expansion of the Second Temple by Herod the Great.
- The **Hurva Synagogue**, the largest of the synagogues in the Jewish Quarter, was founded in the early 18th century but has been destroyed multiple times, most recently in 1948 during the Arab-Israeli War.  Its current rendition was completed in 2010.

It was time to leave the Old City behind, as our next destination awaited.  The hotel would have been quite nice at the time, but thanks to convenient timing, and the staff's desire to adjust us to local time the best they could, now was the time for our next trip, the Mahane Yehuda, a popular market known as the Shuk.
`;

export const shukDay = `
${shukDayIntro}

The Shuk, popular with locals and tourists alike, is the place to buy lots and lots of items.  Even better, we got to go to the Shuk before Shabbat, where everything closes. As such, lots and lots of people go to get everything they need before the Sabbath.

On the way there, we got our first glimpse of rain. It wasn't too bad, but I didn't like seeing the rain.  But being from Portland, I was glad it wasn't our gloomy, constant rain.  But we eventually arrived at the Shuk, and got the chance to explore.  The Shuk was full of people, and on our first day, really overwhelming.  People left and right.  Food left and right.  Crowds of people flooding the path.  Not the best experience.  Plus we all wanted to eat something.  We didn't know what was what.  Signs in Hebrew, unsure of what to eat.  

All we wanted was some Falafel or Shawarma.  But it was easy to be distracted with all the fruits, vegetables and Rugelach on each side.  I stuck with some of the group, and eventually, made a loop back where we started.  After finding a place that had just closed (or didn't want to serve a large group like ourselves, I'm not even certain what ended up happening), we found another place that did serve us.  

I couldn't tell you the name of the place, the items on the menu, nor the cost of meal.  All of it was in Hebrew.  But one thing I could figure out is that I could either say “Falafel” or “Shawarma” to get something to eat.  I ended up choosing option 1.  I ended up eating my meal with Andy, who I found myself getting along with quite well and easy to talk to.  After eating my delicious Falafel, I decided it was time to stop walking and rest my feet for the rest of the time.  I felt like I needed to stop walking and wanted to get off my feet.

I was thankful to get off my feet.  I was thankful to be away from the crowd.  But after Hallie pointed out my head was burnt, suddenly I felt the sunburn on my head.  Of course that's what happens when you're sleep deprived and adjusting to 7-10 hours time change.  Thankfully it wasn't that bad, compared to other sunburns I've gotten in the past.

Once the group returned, shouting my favorite number of our journey for the umpeenth time, our role call number, “3!!!” It was time at last to go to our hotel.  Finally, a time to rest, just as Shabbat was about to start.  Most groups don't get that pleasure.  Most trips should be envious of how things perfectly aligned.  But there's more time to brag later.  Once we arrived at our hotel, it was time to relax, at last.

The hotel itself was decent, it had a nice enough courtyard.  The rooms were okay, but missing key items, such as bar soap.  The beds were kind of small, but none of that matter as it was time to rest.  I fell asleep for about an hour or so, waking up at 6, giving me half an hour before our group met for Shabbat. But I needed to shower, as such, I ended up having to rush to get dressed.

The sleep did not help me much, as I clearly needed more.  During our Shabbat activity, I attempted to light a candle with the matches (which I rarely use), but ended up blowing the other candles out after trying to blow out the match, which brought a few laughs.  Our group brought in the beginning of Shabbat, and once done, it was time to eat dinner, which was buffet style featuring standard meat dishes and lots of neat Israeli salads to try. Not particularly interesting but filling enough.  Thankfully, with Shabbat, it was time to go to bed and sleep in.


`;

export const shabbatIntro = `
Shabbat is celebrated every week as a day of rest.  It starts on Friday night and ends the following night.  We were lucky our first night in Israel was in Shabbat, since adjusting to a different time zone, especially at least 7 hours.  Thanks to our luck, our first night was a great opportunity to sleep, sleep and sleep.  There was plenty of time to sleep, and sleep I did.
`;

export const shabbat = `
${shabbatIntro}

After getting some quality sleep and taking things easy, we had our first activity of the day, which we had to think of our Jewish identity and pick five words from a pile of words on the floor that we considered most important to us.  I focused on family and values, as that's at the core of who I am. We also had to pick something we disagreed with or didn’t know anything about.  I didn't know anything about the IDF.  One of the Israelis in the group, Shay, told us about the IDF, the Israel Defense Forces, and how Jews are required to serve in the military, which I found interesting.  

After our activity, we had lunch then had a few hours in the afternoon to ourselves.  I mostly hung around the hotel, but seeing a red sculpture and viewpoint just outside, I walked down the street to check it out myself.  But I didn't stray too far from the hotel, and wound up returning not too long afterwards, where some in the group were having a yoga session. Some chatted inside, after having to leave the courtyard as a large group took the opportunity to do their Shabbat tradition (I think).

But as the sun started to set, the end of Shabbat came, which we came together to mark its end for the week.  And with that, we were finally able to leave the hotel, for our first night out, a trip back to Mahane Yehuda.  But before the next part of the journey, now would be a good time for our first quiz, to test your knowledge.


`;

export const shukNightIntro = `
Going out at night gave me my first chance to enjoy some nightlife and look hip.  But the weather was teetering between the line of “Should I bring a jacket or not?” Bring it and I risk being too warm and looking bundled up. Not bringing it makes me look hip but risks being too cold and having a possible rain shower hit.  My Mom would always tell me to bring a jacket in this type of weather and I would usually say no, and being in Jerusalem, it made no difference.  So when Hadas asked me the same question, I was more than prepared for a good response.
`;

export const shukNight = `
${shukNightIntro}

Our first night out took us back to the Shuk, but instead of huge crowds of people getting everything they need before Shabbat, there were lights above, restaurants and plenty of artwork on the walls within. Karl Berg was of interest because it was to be our meeting point back to the bus, for those who wanted to go back at 10:30.  I wound up in a large group looking for a place to eat and drink.  As we went restaurant to restaurant, with Chen asking each place whether they could hold a large group, we finally found Beer Bazaar, a pub with local craft beer and seating outside.

Looking at all the beer bottles on the wall, it felt like home, except for all the Hebrew. But they had sections clearly marked for Stouts, IPA's, etc.  But it was clear we would sit outside.  But instead of a table, the staff put a long cloth over a row of small crates in the middle of the alley and grabbed some chairs. That was where we would end up seated.  With the table' barely reaching my knees, I felt like a giant, or at a kids table.  It was quite hilarious to me, but only in Jerusalem, I suppose.

Once settled, it was time to pick a beer to try, which proved to be a tough decision. I went back and forth trying to figure out what I wanted. Stout? IPA? IPA? Stout? I was about ready to pick the IPA, but then we were handed out magnetic coasters to keep.  Looking through all of them, they had the Black Jack Stout, but not the IPA. So I opted for the Stout instead. Good decision indeed.  Now it was time to order food off the menu.

The menu featured standard bar food. Nothing overly amazing. So I ordered myself a pastrami sandwich, the Tarantino. Unfortunately, as the servers were bringing out food, they couldn't get the food names right.  Josh, who joined the group late, took a 'Turkey Sandwich' that 'no one' ordered, having himself not yet ordered food.  What I didn't know at the time was that that the 'Turkey Sandwich' was actually the Pastrami sandwich I had ordered.  To be fair, there was a lot of confusion for such a large group, but I was having fun being out enjoying my beer, so I wasn't too upset over that.  I would know if they called the name Tarantino.  Who can forget Quentin Tarantino?  But they didn't.

Eventually, I got my food and ate my meal, which again, was standard food.  I didn't care, I just wanted to eat and enjoy myself.  After I ate, it was approaching time to get on the bus and go back, for those who wanted to get back.  I didn't want to stay out too late, so I made my way back to Kar Berg and got on the bus back to the hotel.  Sleep was needed for another day.  But Sunday would end up as our difficult day.

`;

export const yadVashemIntro = `
Being Jewish is never easy.  With all the anti-Semitism in the world, our Jewish community must not forget the hate and stay strong.  Especially in this day and age, with the attack on the Jewish community in Pittsburgh having occurred two weeks prior and in our thoughts.  So with all of that, Sunday was our day of difficulty.  No event reminds us of that more than the Holocaust. And no place captures the horrific events like Yad Vashem, Israel's National Holocaust Museum.
`;

export const yadVashem = `
${yadVashemIntro}

Close to our hotel and on the edge of Mount Herzl, our group walked down to Yad Vashem, seeing the views along the way and preparing ourselves mentally for what we were about to see.  Plenty of us had been to Holocaust Museums before, but going to Israel's brings a different light to the experience.  Entering Yad Vashem, we could see the main museum, a long triangular prism building overseeing a valley.  But first, we made our way to another building, where we got an audio player and headphones to listen to our tour guide.  I wished I had brought my headphones, earbuds never stay in my ears.  We also enjoyed some great views of the valley beyond the museum, which were breathtaking to see.

Meeting our tour guide, we first stopped at a tree to honor The Righteous Among the Nations, non-Jews who sacrificed everything to help Jews in Europe during the Holocaust escape and survive.  With all the people who perished, honoring those who did the right thing, risking their own lives, made them deserving of such honor.  A nice way to start the tour.

Entering the main museum, you could see a long pathway within the prism, with the exit sign at the other end.  But one cannot go straight to the exit.  Instead, you walk through the exhibits to the left and right of the main pathway, going through a curving path, with the walls of the prism closing in as you made it further in the museum, until you reach the end and everything opens up again, signifying that better things are ahead.

Going through the museum and listening to our tour guide, who was quite passionate explaining things to us, you could feel the emotions listening to her speak.  Seeing all the pictures from the Holocaust, reading all the facts, learning how much preparation went into such atrocious acts, made me upset inside.  But for anyone with a conscious, you would be upset as well.  But as our tour guide told us, "Never Forget."  It's the main reason the museum was built, to remind everyone never to forget and not let it happen again.

After a long winding path to the exit of the museum, I could see the view of the forest, which combined with the prism, provided an amazing view.  But there was more to see, as our group made its way to the Children's Memorial.  The saddest thing about the Holocaust, was all the children whose lives were lost.  Making our way, we entered a dark room with candles lighting the room, reflected by mirrors throughout the room, where it was dark and eerie to navigate, but touching as the candles were to honor the children' lives lost.

When we were done, we once again could see the forest and the valley in a wonderful view.  But what made it even better was across the valley, you could hear children at a school playing and being lively.  Leaving the Children's Memorial to contrast between the atrocities in the past and the joy of the present, was touching to say the least.  It was one of those moments that felt unbelievable.  With that part of the trip over, it was on to the next part of the trip, Mount Herzl, the Military Cemetery.  But first, a too quick lunch break...

Between Yad Vashem and the Herzl Cemetery was a quick lunch break nearby. Within a nice little mall was a few places to eat.  The first one I saw was McDonalds.  I've been there, done that from my trips to Europe.  I still remember being charged Euro cents for ketchup packets in Austria.  Are you kidding me?  So I passed up the chance at McDonalds.  So what would I have for lunch on this date?

${shakshukaIntro}

I ended up with a group that opted for a more sit down place than anticipated.  I might have gone for a sandwich, and that would have been fine with me, until someone pointed out they had Shakshuka.  I had have no clue what Shakshuka was.  But I certainly like the idea of trying new foods, as long as it doesn't contain foods I don't like.  So what exactly is Shakshuka?  Shakshuka is a dish of eggs poached in a tomato sauce with chili peppers and onions, along with various spices, commonly including cayenne pepper, cumin, paprika and nutmeg. That was enough to convince me to pique my interest.

I also was interested in trying an Iced Coffee.  Our staff told us we had to try the Iced Coffee at some point, that it was absolutely delicious, and nothing like the Iced Coffee back home.  I passed up the opportunity to try some on the first day in the Old City, and I certainly wanted to have some better coffee than the instant coffee that was served at our hotel.  So now was to time to have some Iced Coffee.  So what makes Iced Coffee different?  Instead of being cold, it's more slushie at the top, kind of like a blended coffee but not quite completely blended.  The Iced Coffee back home can be ordered as Cold Coffee.

That was cool and it came out quickly, but the Shakshuka did not.  And with limited time, we couldn't wait around for it.  After a couple times of checking to see when it would be done, our group finally got our Shakshuka's and other dishes, and made our dash towards the bus.  I flagged down our staff and warned them beforehand of the quandary, so there would be no chance we'd be left behind.  So instead of enjoying Shakshuka sitting down, I and a few others ended up having to scarf it down on the bus ride to Mount Herzl and before our tour started.  The meal itself was tasty, but definitely preferred sitting down and not To-Go.  The only thing that could have been worse was for it to explode in my face, but that's not part of my story...

Our next stop was at Mount Herzl, home of Israel's National Cemetery, where many influential Israelis and IDF members are buried. It was here we would learn about Zionism, a term I admit I knew of but didn't fully understand over the years.  This would be the place I would better understand Zionism.
`;

export const herzl = `
${herzlIntro}

As our group entered Mount Herzl, we made our way to a nice marble square, with flags and a tombstone on one side and a place to sit on the other side.  We sat and learned from Hadas about the founder of Zionism, Theodor Herzl.  In the late 19th Century, Jews mostly lived in Europe, with a home of their own.  They were accepted in the West, but the East, not so much.  Due to a rise in Nationalism, Jews in Eastern Europe saw a sharp rise in Anti-Semitism.  It was then that Theodor Herzl came up with Zionism, where the Jews would go back to their ancient homeland and create a state for the Jews.  He was laughed at at the time and passed away in 1904, but his vision came true in 1948 with the creation of Israel.

After learning all of this, we saw the tombstone across the way, which belonged to Herzl.  It was intentionally ordinary, not the extravagant tombstones of other famous people throughout history.  But it was located at the highest point of Mount Herzl, providing a view in all directions.  After this, I added a pebble on top, which for some is traditional.  After Herzl, we headed towards more tombstones.

Our next stop were the tombstones of Israel's former Prime Ministers.  I was particularly drawn to the grave of Yitzhak Rabin, who is buried next to his wife.  I was old enough to remember Rabin signing the Oslo Accord with Yasser Arafat and Bill Clinton, and I was old enough to remember when Rabin was assassinated.  As such, he always held a special spot in my heart when it comes to Israel and its leaders.  Also there were former Prime Ministers Shimon Peres and Golda Meir, the latter whom Jake loves to point out lived in his hometown of Milwaukee.  But we were there to embrace Golda's work for Israel, not Milwaukee. With that, it was off to our next stop in the cemetery.

Walking through the cemetery, there were multiple memorials honoring various groups.  But our next stop was for those who served in the IDF.  We were told the tale of one particular member of the IDF, Yoni Netanyahu, who was killed in action in 1976 during Operation Entebbe, a hostage rescue mission in Uganda; he was the only casualty of that mission. We also heard the story of Michael Levin, an American Jew who came to Israel to serve in the IDF and did everything he could to join and fight.

After hearing these stories and seeing the IDF members passing through the cemetery, it was time to wrap up.  We headed back the way we came, and back to the bus.  Our day of hardship was over.  We learned a lot, but it was difficult to absorb the tragedy of the Holocaust and the passing of those who fought for Israel and the leaders who helped shaped and defined a nation of the Jews.  A much needed break was waiting for us back at the hotel.

# Facts about Mount Herzl
- Mount Herzl is also known as "Mount of Remembrance"
- Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism, was buried at the top of Mount Herzl in 1949, with his remains moved from its original spot in Vienna, Austria, per his wishes once his vision of a Jewish state became complete.
- The main IDF cemetery is located on the north end of the mountain, with plots dedicated to particular battles where members fell during battle.
- The southern slope of the mountain contains the graves of leaders of the country of Israel and those who sacrificed their lives for the country.
- Yad Vashem is located on the western slope of Mount Herzl
- Yoni Netanyahu, who was killed in action during Operation Entebbe, was the older brother of current Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu

After returning from Mount Herzl, another night out was what we needed to at least have a good time on an otherwise challenging day. It would also be our last night in Jerusalem.  With that, after eating dinner at the hotel, we headed to Ben Yehuda Street, a popular part of town in the heart of Jerusalem.
`;

export const benYehuda = `
${benYehudaIntro}

Unlike the night before, the weather was cooler, ending any debate of whether to bring a jacket or not. Also, I didn't totally feel like dressing nice for the occasion.  So yes, I know when a jacket is needed.  Arriving in Ben Yehuda Street, it felt less of a market and more of a square, Ben Yehuda has plenty of souvenir shops, restaurant/bars and even live music in the middle of it all.

It was late, so some of the gift shops I would've considered were closed, so I went with some looking for a bar to have a drink.  Not knowing where to go and with most everything in Hebrew, we leaned in Shay to find us a place to go.  He didn't know where to find a place that could accommodate us, which led him to ask some locals for a recommendation. After following the path provided, it seemed there was no choices, but there was one bar open, the Fishnzon Bar.  And it had seating outside, just enough to fit the whole crew.  Though the selection wasn't huge, I settled on getting a Tuborg, an Amber beer.  

What I didn't know at the time was that every place I went to, except for the Beer Bazaar, offered Tuborg and Carlsberg.  Over the course of the trip, I ended up having Tuborg 3 times.  But none of that matters when you're hanging out with friends and having a good time.  Having a good time but not wanting to stay out too late, we headed back at the designated time.  Jerusalem was plenty of fun, but it was time to get ready for the next part of the journey.


`;

export const giloIntro = `
After a good night sleep, it was time to get ready to leave Jerusalem and learn more about the Israeli-Arab Conflict.  With all the history of Jerusalem and the land of Israel as a whole, there are many things to consider when trying to figure out how to bring peace to the Middle East.  Layers of layers of complexity, emotion, and religiousness make the Israel issue one that cannot be figured out in a day, or a year, or perhaps a lifetime.
`;

export const gilo = `
${giloIntro}

We would get a chance to see the borders firsthand, but first, we had to get a lecture on the Israeli-Arab Conflict.  Our guest speaker, Benji, was definitely not boring, as he frequently said things to make everyone laugh, but at the same time, taught us about the conflict.  There were things I didn't realize about it, and helped put things in perspective.

After the lecture, we said goodbye to the hotel, hopeful the next place would have better amenities, like bar soap.  We drove through Jerusalem, before finding a viewpoint providing a magnificent view of Jerusalem, the Walter Haas Promenade.

There you could see the city from afar, with the Old City walls in the middle. At times, it seemed like the light was shining on the Old City and the Dome of the Rock, as if it wanted to point it out from the distance.  The views were amazing, and even more unreal was when you could hear a chant from the distance, made even more interesting by the Segway group riding their Segways in the area. Something was quite fascinating with that.  After a discussion and some nice pictures, we had another stop to learn about the West Bank.

With all the uncertainty of who controls what within the land of Israel, it was somewhat surprising that a small part of our view would actually be part of the West Bank, currently controlled by Palestine.  With that in mind, our next stop would provide a clearer view of the border.

After going through Jerusalem, where we also caught a glimpse of where the US Embassy will be, under construction while we passed by, we stopped in the neighborhood of Gilo.  There provided a grand view of the area.  One thing that stood out, asides from seeing an office chair in the land below, was a wall.  The wall is part of the border between Israel and the West Bank.  Definitely eerie to think about, but during our discussion, we learned about border security and how and why Israel and the West Bank are divided the way it is.  We could mostly see that the border consists of fence, but only a small part of what we saw was a wall.

After leaving Gilo, we stopped at a little mall for lunch.  It felt like any typical American mall, except for the Hebrew, of course.  I ended up in the food court with more falafel and shawarma food.  I switched it up and ordered a shawarma plate, a tasty fast food style lunch.  The lunch was fine, but my mood was spoiled only slightly as Zach, on a Monday afternoon at 12:30, called me Andrew.  Naturally, I had to remind him my name is Adam, and later asked him the name of the next Andrew I saw.  Payback complete!  After getting some treats and iced coffee, it was time to leave Jerusalem and head for the desert.

# A timeline of the Israeli-Arab Conflict

- Before 1920 the land of Israel was controlled by the **Ottoman Empire**
- April 25, 1920: The **United Kingdom** takes over the land of Israel and creates the **Mandate of Palestine** with the intent to eventually allow the natives to self-determination.
- April 2, 1947: Great Britain seeks the help UN General Assembly to create up a plan to divide Palestine

![UN Partition Plan](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/birthright-israel.bodiewebdesign.com/images/main/un-partition-map.jpg)
- November 29, 1947: The UN votes on the **Partition Plan**, which narrowly passes.  The Israelis accept the plan, wanting security more than anything even if it meant giving up land, but the Palestinians reject the plan, believe they were entitled to all of it since they had previous control and the Jews left before they arrived.
- May 14, 1948: The Jews declare independence, creating the state of Israel
- May 15, 1948: The **Arab-Israeli War** begins, pitting Israel against the Arab League, primarily consisting of Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Yemen (and briefly Lebanon).

- March 10, 1949: Israel wins the war, keeping the land given to them in the Partition Plan with additional Arab land. Egypt takes control of the **Gaza Strip**, and Jordan takes control of the **West Bank**.
- June 5-10, 1967: The **Six-Day War** occurs, as Israel reclaims the West Bank, Gaza Strip and takes over Egypt's **Sinai Peninsula** (**Golan Heights** was also part of the conflict but we didn't even talk about Golan Heights)

![Six-Day War Map](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/birthright-israel.bodiewebdesign.com/images/main/1967-israel-map.png)
- March 26, 1979: Israel and Egypt sign the Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty, in which Israel agrees to return the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt
- September 13, 1993: Israel and Palestine, with the help of the United States, agree to the Oslo Accord, their first face-to-face meeting, with the intent to resolve the Arab-Israeli Conflict.
- 1995: The Oslo Accord II is created in addition with the intention of creating a Palestinian statehood within 5 years
- July 25, 2000: The Camp David Summit to finalize the end of the Israel-Arab Conflict is held, but no agreement is reached

# Other facts about the Conflict
- **West Bank** refers to being west of the Jordan River. 
- Tel Aviv can reach part of the West Bank within 9 miles.
- The Jews see the conflict as wanting **Security**.  The Arabs see the conflict as fixing an **Injustice** for losing the Arab-Israeli War of 1948
- Before 1948, there were significant Jewish communities in all he Arab countries.  But after the war, they were all expelled.
- The Islamic view of their leadership resides as one big empire known as a **Caliphate**, which for them, stretches from Northern Africa to Asia.  Connecting the two regions is Israel, hence a reason they consider Israel important to them.

export const laqyeIntro = `
Though Jerusalem is a beautiful city full of history and culture, it was time to leave and see other parts of Israel.  On a 7 Day trip, we can only get a taste of what Israel has to offer.  We would have to spend months, seeing everything Israel had to offer.  But a small piece of the pie is better than no piece of the pie.  With that in mind, the adventure headed south towards the desert.  Our first stop was in the town of Laqye, within the Southern District.

`;

export const laqye = `
${laqyeIntro}

Driving through the desert was typical of what I'd expect, really dry, sunny, little signs of civilization and green.  Not that much different from the deserts on the west coast.  But entering Laqye, things started to change.  It felt like I was looking at pictures of Africa, with its architecture, vegetation and surrounding scenery.  A few mosques were in the distance, which were beautiful to see.  It was clear we were in a different place.  So where were we? In a village of the Bedouins.

Who are the Bedouins?  They are an Arab minority known for their nomadic lifestyle.  There are a few communities in the area that the Bedouins live in Israel.  Our bus driver, Ahmed, we learned, is a Bedouin, though from the northern part of Israel, which makes him not so much of a desert dweller as the ones we saw in Laqye.

Our next stop was at the business of a Bedouin female Oncologist named Amal.  Entering her room, it was clear how much of a different world we were in, the room was a hut with artifacts on the wall, rugs on the floor and little to no electricity.  A different experience, but neat to see nonetheless.

Amal told us her story about how she overcame being a female minority in her community to become a successful oncologist.  I expected her speech to be more about being a Bedouin minority in Israel, but nonetheless, it was an impressive story of hard work and persistence.  During her talk, a young boy brought everyone a little cup of tea, which I thought was really tasty.  In the end, Amal answered our questions and pointed us to the gift shop with various handmade items.  As we left Laqye, we enjoyed a beautiful sunset.  But it was time to go to our hotel in Arad, and prepare ourselves for Masada.
`;

export const aradIntro = `
We arrived in the town of Arad, where our hotel was for the night.  Since it was dark, we couldn't get a few of Arad, but entering the hotel area, we could see how spread out it was compared to Bait Vagan.  The rooms looked more modern, had more amenities, including hand soap, as well as a TV.  

`;

export const arad = `
${aradIntro}

Curious as to what was on the TV and the Hebrew associated with it, I flipped through some channels and saw an NBA game being played, between Detroit and Charlotte.  I found it to be funny that most of it was in English with small parts of the broadcast being in Hebrew.  Of course, the game had already been played the day before (Charlotte won), which explained why there were no commercials, but it was fun to watch a game to see if there was any Hebrew in the broadcast.

TV aside, the room was bigger, and with the other Adam joining for the night, we also had more beds, including bunk beds.  Fortunately, no one had to share a bunk bed, which Adam ended up taking. But while the rooms were an upgrade, an unscheduled part of the trip lurked in our path.

Having just learned about the Arab-Israeli Conflict, it seemed, perhaps ironic, that Hamas, the group in control of Gaza, would take this opportunity to fire off 460 rockets towards Israel, in what was deemed their highest intensity of attacks since the 2014 war between Israel and Gaza that had lasted 50 days.  Israel intercepted some of the rockets and fired back, causing buildings on both sides to be damaged.

That, of course, was immediately brought to our attention, as Gaza has rockets that could reach Masada, the beginning of our adventure the next day, along with Tel Aviv, our final destination of the next day.  With that in mind, there was a possibility of our activities being cancelled.  How would we know? By hearing a loud alarm. What would happen if this occurred? We would go to the hotel's bomb shelter.  After being shown where to find the bomb shelter, it was time to eat.  After eating, we had another activity, Where the Wind Blows, a musical chairs meets gladiator event of silly admissions.  I ended up scraping my arm at one point and admitting to once driving 100 mph (I accomplished that the year before in [Idaho](https://wildwildwest.bodiewebdesign.com)).  A perfect way to forget that rockets were being fired from Gaza.

But with the day I'd been waiting for the whole trip coming, I went to sleep wondering what would happen.  I didn't feel Gaza would escalate their attacks, but you never know. Would I spend the next day on top of Masada, or stuck in a bomb shelter with our group and a bunch of screaming kids?

export const desertIntro = `
The following morning, I woke up to a beautiful day, with the sun rising, and some rather cute cats our group fell in love with.  It was clear that there would be no escalation from Gaza.  And with that, after breakfast, our day of exercise would begin with a trip to Masada.

`;

export const desert = `
${desertIntro}

After leaving Arad and the cute kitties behind, it was a half an hour away to Masada, which took us through various twists and turns in the desert.  The music was playing on the bus, with a little karaoke, particularly The Notorious B.I.G. classic Juicy performed by Boston Andrew, which brought cheers. The scenery was typical of the desert, until we could see the Dead Sea in the distance.  Suddenly, views of the sea appeared, which were beautiful to see.  Before we knew it, we'd arrive at Masada.
`;

export const romanIntro = `
Before my trip to Israel and learning of the itinerary, there was one place I wasn't aware of that got me really excited upon research.  That of course, was Masada National Park.  Knowing I would have to hike up and down Masada, I spent more time being physically active to prepare myself.  Sure, I had done hikes longer, higher and more treacherous. 
[Smith Rock](https://adventures.bodiewebdesign.com/smith-rock)
in Central Oregon was the pinnacle of my hiking experience, but I was much younger back then.  How would I hold up nine years later?
`;

export const roman = `
${romanIntro}

Arriving at Masada, I was amazed with the scenery.  Masada itself, a Mesa in the desert, was beautiful to see.  Also visible was again, the Dead Sea.  An amazing view.  On the other side was still the desert.  A beautiful and not too hot day as it usually gets in the summer, made this a sight to see.  In addition to getting our first answer questioned (the bathroom was to the left of the bus), we managed to get plenty of pictures showing our excitement by jumping at all once.  We were really excited!

Heading up the Roman Ramp wasn't too much of a hassle.  It only took about 15 minutes.  The views of the desert were incredible.  Seeing IDF soldiers marching down brought a sense of pride.  In all, the Roman Ramp provided a good introduction.  Not quite the Rocky moment I thought I would get, but there was more to come.

`;

export const masadaIntro = `
After heading through the gate on top of Masada, we were treated with ancient architecture, sweeping views all around, and plenty of desert to go around.  Enough to make you feel like you’re on top of the world, with the sun shining through the clouds, as if you’re someplace special.

`;

export const masada = `
${masadaIntro}


After getting plenty of pictures surrounding and of myself showcasing exactly how I felt in such a special place, we briefly stopped for a little rest.  Perfect seeing that we walked up the Roman ramp.  After resting, we headed to the area of the Northern Palace, where we learned about Herod the Great and his palaces on Masada.  But it was a little difficult to pay attention at times with all the birds chirping and flying to our area.  Known as Tristram’s Starling, these little black birds were quite the entertainment.  A more serious issue that we had was that Hadas was beginning to lose her voice; by the end of the day, it would be down to a rasp.

Afterwards, we headed to the Western Palace and entered a bathhouse, where we could see the remains.  It was rather interesting to see the black line throughout the structure indicating everything that was original on the bottom, and everything that was reconstructed on the top.

Our next stop on Masada was the Synagogue, which was neat knowing had once been on Masada.  The remains were mostly seating area with a few pillars and one room you could look inside, but not go into.  Despite this, I found the Synagogue interesting.  But the two spots on the southern end of Masada would prove to be the coolest parts of Masada we saw.

Somewhere along the way, I received a text message from T-Mobile's international carrier, Cellcom, welcoming me to Jordan, which was odd considering I wasn’t in Jordan. I could see Jordan on the other side of the Dead Sea, but I definitely didn’t set foot in Jordan. I found that to be quite amusing.  It definitely put things in perspective as to how close I was to another country.

Heading to the south, I figured we would head to the end, but I was surprised to see the group go down into a cistern.  It was clear why we were here, as the sun shined perfectly into the cistern, creating a beam of light.  It was quite an event to see, one that appears to only occur at a certain time of day.  Plenty of picture opportunities in such limited time, I managed to get one of myself just before we had to leave.  And though others got a better picture, it’s better than nothing.  But the experience was definitely a highlight.

Finally, we headed to a viewpoint along the edge, providing an amazing view of the surrounding desert and mountains.  While the views were awesome, it was what we were told to do that made it more amazing.  We were told to shout the name of someone we wanted to come visit Masada.  We did, and an amazing echo could be heard across the way about a second later.  It was quite surreal.  We shouted a few more times, one of which was to go “Quack!”  Someone was inspired because of the person who wore an Oregon Ducks shirt, which of course was me.  It felt like the perfect shirt to wear on Masada, to spread my wings on top of Masada. 

Ducks aside, the views were quite amazing and the ruins on Masada were awesome to see.  But it was time to leave Masada and head down the more challenging Snake Path, estimated time 45 minutes down to the bottom.

# Masada facts
- Masada is the Hebrew translation for the word "Fortress"
- The fortress on Masada was built by King Herod between 37-31 BCE
- The cliffs of Masada are about 300 feet on the west side, but about 1,300 feet on the east side
- One of the final battles of the First Jewish-Roman War, the siege of Masada, took place on top of Masada around 73 CE.  It ended in a mass suicide of 960 Sicarii Jews, who committed suicide rather than be conquered.
- Due to its remoteness and arid environment, it wasn’t for almost 2,000 years until Masada had human contact.
- Due to the extreme heat, summertime visits to Masada usually start hiking before sunrise, closing in the afternoon when temperatures reach over 100 degrees.
- The Masada Cableway has a bottom station elevation of 257 m below sea level, and an upper station elevation of 33 m above sea level, making it the lower tramway in the world

export const snakeIntro = `
Going up the Roman Path to Masada wasn't too painful.  It didn't take too long.  But the real challenge was going down, as the east side of Masada dropped down a much higher elevation than the west side of Masada.  As such, the estimated time we were given was 45 minutes.  After making sure we had gone to the bathroom and filling up our water bottles all the way to the top, the time to go down Masada began, with me wanting to track my time and effort on my Apple Watch.
`;

export const snake = `
${snakeIntro}

Once we were prepared, the journey down the Snake Path began with amazing views of the Dead Sea and Desert, along with the Cableway going up and down to the surface.  The switchbacks were steep, but not too steep.  At first, there were railings to assist, but about halfway through, the rails were no longer there.  It was going to be a long trip down, but thankfully I had someone to talk to for half of the walk down.  That might not be a big deal for most, but for someone as shy as myself, having Pittsburgh Andrew to talk with for half of the way down was kind of a big deal for me.  

After making it to the bottom, we were relieved to have completed the walk down.  Perhaps this was more of the Rocky moment I had anticipated would be walking up to Masada.  In all, it took me 38 minutes to go from the top of Masada to the bottom, an elevation drop of about 1000 feet, at a distance of 1.2 miles.  Though I was quite exhausted, it was well worth all of it.  Going up to Masada, seeing all the ruins and natural sights, and the views going down.  Everything's better when you work at it and savor the experience.

Afterwards, we entered the Visitor Center.  There I entered the Gift Shop to look around.  Seeing postcards, I thought this would be the perfect chance to buy postcards for my wonderful new Auntie Pam and Uncle Randy.  I picked a Masada postcard for Auntie Pam because the desert landscape is similar to Utah, while I picked a Jerusalem postcard for Uncle Randy because of his passion to religion.  I bought the post cards, but unfortunately, I wound up misplacing them somewhere in Tel Aviv later on.  Sorry Auntie Pam and Uncle Randy.  Though our trip to Masada was over, the nature and walking was far from over.  We had more stops on the way, not to mention a drive to Tel Aviv.  Today was going to be an awesome day! 

`;

export const nachalIntro = `
After Masada, we had another hike on the schedule, but one not nearly as grueling. That would be at the Ein Gedi Nature Reserve, a nature park not too far from Masada with lovely scenery, wildlife, and plenty of surprises.
`;

export const nachal = `
${nachalIntro}

There were a lot of people at the entrance, and it did feel crowded, but once we started walking, it felt like we were in an Oasis.  We were told they would be a few opportunities to see some wildlife.  But few wasn’t enough.  There ended up being plenty of animals to see. 

Most prominent was the Ibex, which I recognized as the logo featured on Masada National Park.  At first there were a few in the distance, but heading up the path, more of them approached, passing through the area.  Some of them were quite majestic, especially the male Ibexes with the horns.  My only concern was a couple of them had collars placed around their necks.  It made me wonder how wild they really are.

Also present along the trail were cute little marmot like creatures known as the Hyrax.  These little guys were also found, and though there weren’t as many, they were adorable to watch.

But none of this could match the waterfalls along the path.  The last thing I expected to see in Israel were waterfalls, especially in the desert.  And while they weren’t as tall or powerful like the many waterfalls found in Oregon (Multnomah Falls and the others on the Columbia River Gorge, along with the 10 waterfalls at Silver Falls are amongst the best), they desert scene made these waterfalls truly photogenic and majestic.  It was quite inspiring to see.

We reached the end of our path at a waterfall with a pool of water to go into.  Some jumped right in, though I put my feet in the water.  I didn’t go too far in, I figured I would save that for the Dead Sea.  But with a perfect blend of desert, water and green, this area was quite amazing to me, and totally unexpected.  It was reasons like this that I chose not to research all the places on the itinerary beforehand.  After this, we headed back in preparation for our next stop, the lowest place on Earth: the Dead Sea.

# Ein Gedi Nature Reserve Facts
- The Nubian Ibex is a member of the goat family, with the Nubian Ibex, a desert-dwelling variety, being found in mountainous desert areas in Africa and the Middle East.
- The Rock Hyrax is a small mammal that looks similar to a marmot, but like other Hyraxes, has more in common with elephants and manatees, in part due to its genital location and flattened nails
- Hyraxes are also known by some as Dassies.
- The stream running through the nature reserve is named after King David
- Yael, a biblical heroine from the Book of Judges, is the hebrew translation of Ibex
- The Rock Hyrax typically spends about 95% of its time resting, usually basking in the sun in what some consider to be their way of thermoregulation

export const deadSeaIntro = `
After a lot of hiking, we all needed to rest.  And what a better way to relax and take it easy than going to the Dead Sea, where you can float in the water, cover yourself in its healing mud and otherwise just have fun on the salty beach.  Fortunately, it wasn’t too far from the nature hike, and equally fortunate, there was a spa to eat.
`;

export const deadSea = `
${deadSeaIntro}

After arriving at the Ein Gedi Spa, I ate a little lunch, not too appetizing, but enough to fill me up.  Then it was time to get into my beach clothes.  Off came the shoes and socks, on came the sandals.  Off came the shorts, on came the swimsuit.  I waited to take my shirt off until I reached the sea itself.  After changing, we hopped on a tractor bus to take us to the Dead Sea itself.  Thanks to the rapid decline in water levels over the last 15+ years, this mode of transportation was created, as the Spa was originally built on the coastline.  An interesting fact, but a sad reminder of how man can decimate the natural beauty in this world.

Reaching the Dead Sea, it was time to jump in the water.  As it was quite salty, the Dead Sea provided opportunities to float regardless of depth and also gave way to fascinating salt formations and other unique landscapes.  The views of the Dead Sea, the Moab Mountains across the sea in Jordan, and everything else were quite beautiful to see.  I wanted to focus first on taking pictures, so I didn’t tread too far within the water.  

Afterwards, I walked over to a muddy part of the grounds to try the healing mud.  Having scraped my arm the night before when the wind blew, I thought I try it on there.  Attempting to cross the mud, I soon found myself getting my sandals stuck in the mud, barely able to get my sandals out of the mud.  At one point, I nearly lost my balance and came extremely close to dropping my phone in the mud.  That would’ve been a complete disaster, but thankfully it was diverted.

That led me to take a break from picture taking, as I found myself wanting to enjoy myself and not worry about my phone.  I washed off the little bit of mud in the sea, but then went back to the mud to cover myself completely in mud, minus the face, swimsuit and sandals.  Soon I looked like a mud man and joined the others in the group covered in mud.  Some had ended up looking darker with their mud, and wondering why, I found out that they had purchased their mud at the Spa.  I enjoyed being in the real mud, a definite once-in-a-lifetime experience.

But the mud couldn’t stay on forever, so I walked back in the Dead Sea to clean the mud off of me.  I then took the opportunity to float in the sea.  As I don’t know how to swim, I felt uneasy, despite the saltiness of the water, of floating on my back, as plenty of people do in the Dead Sea.  But I still managed to get off my feet and float from within.  It was a fun way to spend the afternoon after such a long day of hiking.  But there were a lot of annoying bugs flying around, which I didn't particularly care for.  That part I was glad to get rid of.

Afterwards, there was a shower on the coast to clean off any excess mud I missed.  Then it was time to hop back on the tractor bus back to the spa.  Another shower soon awaited at the spa and I cleaned myself off one last time, to put on my regular clothes back on.  The day in nature was over, and it was the best day of the trip.  But it wasn’t quite over.  An extended bus ride was just what we needed, as it was a two hour drive to the greatest city in the world: Tel Aviv.

# Dead Sea Facts
![Dead Sea Level Comparison](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/birthright-israel.bodiewebdesign.com/images/main/dead-sea-level.jpg)
- Though named the Dead Sea, as it is not connected to any Ocean, it is technically a lake
- At about 418 feet below sea level, the Dead Sea is the lowest elevation on land in the world
- The Dead Sea contains about 35% salt, one of the most saltiest bodies of water in the world.  The typical body of water contains about 3%
- The water level of the Dead Sea has been rapidly declining since the 1930s, going from 410 sq mi to 234 sq mi, primarily caused by diverting water from the Jordan River from the north, the only connecting body of water to the Dead Sea
- Plans to connect a waterway between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, known as the Red Sea-Dead Sea Waterway Conveyance, are currently underway to stabilize the water within the Dead Sea and provide drinking water for Israel/Jordan/Palestine
- Its name come from the fact that most organisms can't live in it; only miniscule bacteria and fungi can survive in the Dead Sea

It was quite an adventure going from our hotel in Arad to Masada, the nature hike in Ein Gedi and the Dead Sea.  These were some of the things, particularly Masada, that I had been looking forward to the most.  But the day was far from over.  Now it was time for a bus ride to the coolest, modern, partying city in Israel, which of course, is Tel Aviv.

Arriving in the evening, the city from what I could see, was lit up with plenty of tall buildings surrounding the area.  We arrived at our hotel, basically right on the beach, providing a great location.  Unfortunately, I was quite terrified, along with my new roommate Jaron, that our room only had one measly bed.  Something didn’t seem right, as I was first given a key to another room.  So after a shower in a small bathroom, I found Hadas, who tried her best with such a raspy voice, to explain to the hotel clerk of this mixup.  We wound up with a bigger room with two beds, a much bigger bathroom.  More on that later.

Once that frustrating ordeal was over, it was time to eat.  We walked to a restaurant called Maganda, which Jake told us he was paying for (which proved to be false). But regardless of that, despite my prior frustrations, ended up being the best meal of the trip, complete with appetizers, kabobs, and some wine we got separately, I wound up sharing some Israeli Sauvignon Blanc.  A great way to celebrate a wonderful day of fun.  But things were just beginning in Tel Aviv.  After dinner, we got a chance to explore Tel Aviv at night.

I wound up joining Zack, Andy, Sammie and Paige after Zack asked if I wanted to join them for a drink.  I was cool with that, and asking Hadas where the Flea Market was, we opted to walk down to the Flea Market, which wasn't too far from the restaurant and hotel.  Heading down, the city lit up , with a vibe similar to Miami (a place I've never been to, but with the skyscrapers along the beach and tropical feel, it made perfect sense).  The skyscrapers were tall, not super-tall, but quite pretty to see in the night.  Also visible and quite beautiful was a view of the historic part of Tel Aviv, Jaffa.  Even the beach looked beautiful in the night, with just enough light to actually see the beach, but dark enough to know it was the evening.  Eventually, we found ourselves approaching the Flea Market with the Clock Tower in the middle, which itself was quite pretty lit up as well.  

At the Flea Market, we found a hip looking bar and ordered a drink.  I had something I hadn't had in a while, a Negroni, with equal parts Gin, Sweet Vermouth and Campari.  A nice drink to have that I don't usually have, so whenever I have one in the future, I'll remember Tel Aviv.  The waitress even gave us free shots of some liquor, which I believe is something popular in Israel.  Whatever it was called, I had a sip of the anise flavored liquor, but wasn't quite eager to take the shot with the Negroni and the wine I had during dinner.  Next time, I'll take the shot.  After the bar, we walked back to the Hotel, about 20-30 minutes away, but easy to find since all we needed to do was to find the beach and follow it up north.  It was 12:30 am, technically the next day, but who cares about semantics, right?
