Flying to Israel, the best way to fly is through their official carrier, El Al.  The journey to Israel began at the check-in counter, where the Birthright group met.  Not wanting to stay at my hotel in North Bergen, New Jersey, for long, I left as early as I could but not arrive super early.  I ended up arriving around 8:15 or so.  The group was small, but thanks to Zach&apos;s gray Lowe&apos;s jacket he mentioned on our Facebook page, I knew I was in the right section.

${elAlIntro}

For the next hour, more and more people showed up, with the early birds like me pointing out to them "Check in over there" where are staff member Anabelle was sitting, complete with name tags for everyone to wear.  Once the other staff member Jake arrived, having just flown to the aiport from Israel, we were ready to get our first instructions.

We learned of our next steps, and then found out about El Al&apos;s extra security measures.  Before going through TSA, one must face questions from airline representatives.  A &apos;lucky&apos; few got an additional round of questioning.  It&apos;s as if they wanted to know your life story.  Fortunately for me, I wasn&apos;t one of the lucky ones.  Once through the TSA, our group was given a couple of hours to rest before meeting up with our staff.  After passing through the creepy New Jersey Hall of Fame kiosks featuring such umremarkable famous New Jersians as Connie Chung and someone else I don&apos;t even remember, rest was really needed.  Unfortunately, the more convenient charging stations for my iPhone and watch didn&apos;t work.  Only in New Jersey, I suppose.

At 11:30, it was time for our first activity to get to know each other better.  We had a ball with random questions to answer.  Our question was based on where our right thumb landed on the ball.  I got hit in the head when the ball was passed to me, but I answered my unremarkable question of what my favorite sports championship game to watch (Basketball).  Other questions were quite silly.

After learning of the next steps, we finally got to board the plane.  What a huge plane it was!  I was amazed to find out my seat was in row 57.  Of course, I ended up in the very last row.  There were three sections of the plane.  I was in the middle section on the aisle to the left side.  The bathroom was across the aisle from me.  It was so close, I could grab toilet paper from the bathroom while remaining in my seat.  The seats were as comfy for an airplane, and with TV screens in front of you, there was plenty of entertainment.  You could watch movies, TV shows, listen to music, and view the airplane&apos; location, with an interactive interface and virtual views of just about anything you could imagine; from the standard view to Cockpit view.  Even their safety video was more entertaining than you would ever find in America.

Thankfully, there was plenty of entertainment available, because the flight was 10 hours from Newark to Tel Aviv.  We were provided two meals, both with a certificate of Kashruth (sorry Uncle Fred, no Ham and Cheese sandwich).  There were plenty of Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men on the plane, who refused to sit next to females.  They also congregated to the back of the plane, where I was, appearing to pray.  I tried to get some sleep on the plane.  I thought I was in a good position to do so.  In the back of the plane, in an aisle, and decent leg room.  But despite my best efforts, I just couldn&apos;t do it.  I ended up watching Mission Impossible: Fallout, which I&apos;d never seen before as it was new, and having watched Rogue Nation a few days before, it was perfect for me to watch Fallout. After 10 hours, we finally landed in Israel at around 6:30 am, local time.

export const jerusalemIntro = `After a 10 hour flight from Newark to Israel, it was time to hit the ground running.  First arriving at the Ben Gurion Airport, the journey to Israel brought us to the holiest city in the world, Jerusalem, where a tour of the Old City began, so we could understand why Jerusalem is so important to the Jewish people, as well as the Muslims and the Christians.  As Shabbat neared, we also ventured to Machane Yehuda, a Shuk where everyone was making sure to get what they needed before sundown.`
