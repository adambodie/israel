			<h1>Jukebox!</h1>
			<p>Over the course of our trip, we managed to hear a few songs, mostly on the bus.  From karaoke jams to popular Israeli songs, and of course, Take Me Home Country Roads, there were quite a few songs we heard. Check out the Jukebox to play the most memorable songs of the trip.  FYI, the last song was one from an album I was playing on my iPhone throughout the trip, <em>Pieces of a Man</em> by Mick Jenkins.  I chose this particular song due to the Tel Aviv reference.</p>
